## About

This is a fairly basic program. The index.html page allows the user to input an equation, and the result will be calculated and displayed.

The basic instructions for entering equations are displayed on index.html. The calculator follows order of operations (PEMDAS), but currently cannot handle nested parentheses, absolute values, or variables.

Note: It is important to format the equation as specified. The method used by the current version of this program relies on the spacing to recognize elements (numbers and operands).
